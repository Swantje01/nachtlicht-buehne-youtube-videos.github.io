We are inviting you to count again! Germany has a new law to help save energy. This "[Kurzfristenenergieversorgungssicherungsmaßnahmenverordnung](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/ensikumav/BJNR144600022.html)" restricts, among other things, the use of facade lighting and advertising. Since the law is very new, it is likely that many businesses and public authorities have not yet had time to adapt their lighting. It would therefore be interesting to see how lighting practice changes over the next months.

While we don’t have the capability to run large campaigns this fall, the app is the perfect instrument for citizen scientists to investigate how lighting in their community is changing. With that in mind, everyone is welcome to create a record of lighting change using the app. If you live in another country that has passed similar energy saving laws, feel free to use [Nightlights App](#key-links-and-information-when-using-the-nightlights-app) as well. Here are a few guidelines that can help you if you’d like to take such data.

**First**: choose a street that has lights that are covered under the law (e.g. a street in a pedestrian or shopping area with signs and lit facades). If a transect (from one street corner to another) already exists in the app, please use that one. If you need to define your own transect, please consult [the instructions from our last campaign](/assets/docs/EN_Nachtlichter_time_change_campaign.pdf).

**Second**: survey that street well before 22:00 and again later that night well after 22:00. We recommend completing your first survey before 21:00, and starting your later survey after 22:30.

**Third**: survey the street again every 1-4 weeks, in order to see how things have changed. The comparison will be easiest if you always visit at similar times to your first observation.

And that’s it! If it turns out that a lot of people collect data (e.g. data from 50 streets or more), we could provide valuable information to the Bundestag regarding the impact that the law has had.

#### **We count lights, because the night counts**

Satellite images of the earth at night show a worldwide increase in nocturnal light emissions and light pollution, including in Germany. Unfortunately, we don't presently know what types of lights (e.g. streetlights, advertising) are driving this increase, or for that matter, how many of each different type of light there are. Our group of citizen scientists and researchers at GFZ have therefore developed an app to count light sources along street segments – from illuminated windows and advertising signs to street lamps and traffic lights.

##### The Nightlights campaigns - in Germany and worldwide

From the end of August 2021 until mid November 2021, **more than 200 citizen scientists** have counted and classified almost **a quarter of a million artificial light sources** in public streets and squares. While counting lights they have **walked 645 kilometers and covered a total of 22 square km** in different field sites in Germany and worldwide.

The data was collected in German cities and communities, notably in Achtenwehr, Berlin, Bochum, Borkheide, Dresden, Erlangen, Erfurt, Freising, Fulda, Herzogenaurach, Köln, Leipzig, Leverkusen, Potsdam, Preußisch-Oldendorf, Rosenheim, Trier, Wittenberg, Würzburg, and places outside Germany, including Canada, France, Indonesia, Italy, Irland, Serbia, Spain, Turkey and the USA.

The project participants are now involved in the evaluation of the data and in the work on scientific publications. The first results are expected from mid-2022. Together the nightlights network will also contribute to more awareness for sustainable lighting.

##### Goals of the Nightlights campaigns

We aim to understand how the different sources of light emissions contribute to the light emissions observed by satellite. For this reason, we are sampling lights over large areas, in order to be able to compare what we observe with what satellites see.

We will also investigate and document local differences in the numbers and types of lighting in different places. For example, we will compare city centers to residential neighborhoods, and campaign communities to oneanother.

We create awareness for the transition to sustainable lighting, by inviting citizens in different cities to use our app, participate in our nightlight measurement campaigns, and thus actively engage with artificial lighting and its side effects.

Although the 2021 Nightlights campaigns ended in November 2021, you can still use the app, if you like. The first step is to complete our [tutorial](/assets/docs/nl_tutorial_en/tutorial.html), and then [install the Nachtlichter app on your phone](https://lichter.nachtlicht-buehne.de/) (it's a progressive web app). If you'd just like to try it out, you can create your own street segment from within the app.
